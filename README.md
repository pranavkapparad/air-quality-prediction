# air-quality-prediction
Air quality is one of the major issues of this century and hence it's important to analyse the air quality 
as a first step to come up with solutions.
The model is designed and tested using air quality dataset of Wuhan collected during and after the implementation
of lockdown. The project implements both classification and regression techniques in order to predict the AQI values.
Methods such as SMOTE and Additive Time Series Analysis are also implemented.
